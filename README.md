Mimi's Hospital
====================
###### Made by: Mark, Corey, Jaudat, Furkan
Description
---------------------
This project is a database modeling a hospital for a final project in our cecs 323 "Database Fundamentals Course"
The project only has me committing to it as we had to utilize collabedit.com in order to collaborate on the implementation
due to not having enough time to get everyone familiar with using git.
